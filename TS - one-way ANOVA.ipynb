    "The one-way ANOVA is a test that is often used to determine if there are differences in means between different categories. ANOVA is short for ANalysis Of VAriances, since to determine if the means are different an investigation in different variances is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the test I'd use if I have a nominal and a scale (interval/ratio) variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "There a few different ways you can do this test with Python. If you have a pandas dataframe, the easiest method (in my opinion) is by using the Pingouin package or the statsmodels.api. You can simply let it know which fields are involved and basically you're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have separate lists of scores then the scipy package could be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll show an example for all three, and in the appendix how you can even avoid almost entirely packages by going over the formulas involved (it still needs a package for the F-distribution, which would go too far to also do without a package).\n",
